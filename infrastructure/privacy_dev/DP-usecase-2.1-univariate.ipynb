    "## Differential Privacy and Privacy Protection\n",
    "Differential Privacy (DP) is a mathematical framework that provides strong, quantifiable privacy guarantees when analyzing and sharing data. Its core idea is to ensure that the inclusion or exclusion of a single individual’s data does not significantly affect the output of an analysis, thereby limiting what can be inferred about any one person. This limits the ability of an attacker to infer whether someone participated in the dataset, even if they possess additional background information. To achieve this, DP algorithms inject carefully calibrated random noise into computations, such as LOO mean, making it mathematically difficult to isolate individual contributions. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this section we show how DP can be applied to data. This example revolves around anonymizing a dataset of individual heights that contains significant outliers. \n",
    "\n",
    "## The goal\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to protect the data without compromising the privacy of any individual, especially in high risk or adversarial environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Down below we use usecase-2.1 individual's height.\n"

    "## User Output\n",
    "\n",
    "A data user on the SIESTA platform is typically a researcher from an institution, aiming to answer a scientific question using sensitive data. Since the original data cannot be downloaded directly due to privacy concerns, the data user must develop their analysis pipeline using an anonymized dataset that mimics the structure of the real data. Once developed, the analysis is containerized, where this containerized pipeline is then executed by the platform operator on the original data. \n",
    "\n",
    "After applying **differential privacy** techniques on the results, it will be shared back with the data user. If the result is injected with noise before releasing it, for example, by adding Laplace noise proportional to the L1 sensitivity of the mean. The attacker cannot recover the true values exactly, because the values are altered with noise. \n",
