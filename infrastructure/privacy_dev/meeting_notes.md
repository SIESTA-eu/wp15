# Notebook 6
- [ ] use an MRI and an EEG dataset for dimenionality
- [ ] for MRI consider places where we have 0
- [ ] describe how outliers are made for MRI and for EEG (like a sub-region)

- specific EEG handling
- [ ] use output from use case - not raw data since this is what global privacy does
- [X] use existing neibourghs
- [ ] ensure the loaded data and the neibourghs are ordered in the same channel order
- [ ]
