# Notebook 2.2
## 1. Problem Statement [ ]
## 2. Structure & Flow
Planned or current sections in the notebook:
- [x] Data loading
- [x] Solution explained
- [x] Simulations
- [x] Interpretation

# Notebook 3 & 5
- [x] redone, optimized, validated

# Notebook 4
- [ ] simulations: outlier in one or both variables
- [ ] simulations: adjust covariance matrix with 0, 0.4, 0.9 off diagonal
- [ ] plot per variable and variables together


# Notebook 6
- [ ] use an MRI and an EEG dataset for dimenionality
- [ ] for MRI consider places where we have 0
- [ ] use the optimized code from notebook 5 (vectorized loo)
- [ ] use the cholensky favctorization to create multivariate Gaussian (see notebook 5)
- [ ] ensure regulatized covariance (see notebook 5)
- [ ] describe how outliers are made for MRI and for EEG (like a sub-region)
