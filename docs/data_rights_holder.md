# Data rights holder

## Audience

This document is aimed at the data rights holder, i.e., the person or organization responsible for the dataset. We assume that the SIESTA data rights holder is working in a different institute than the [data user](./data_user.md); if they were working in the same institution, they could share directly and the SIESTA platform would not be needed.

## Introduction

The data rights holder decides under which conditions the dataset can be shared, with whom, and they are responsible for initiating the data transfer. It is also the responsibility of the data rights holder to organize the data according to the [BIDS](https://bids.neuroimaging.io) (Brain Imaging Data Structure) standard, which is a formalized framework for organizing and describing neuroimaging and behavioral data in a consistent, machine-readable manner to facilitate data sharing and reproducibility.

The BIDS-formatted input data is for example structured as

```console
input
├── dataset_description.json
├── participants.tsv
├── participants.json
├── README.md
├── sub-01
|   | ses-01/...
|   └ ses-02/...
├── sub-02
|   | ses-01/...
|   └ ses-02/...
..
└── sub-NN
    | ses-01/...
    └ ses-02/...
```

The [platform operator](./platform_operator.md) and the data rights holder have to settle on a way to transfer the data. We assume in the following that the data rights holder is working at some research institution in Europe (or at home, for that matter) and that the SIESTA platform operator is working at the compute center that hosts the SIESTA platform. The data is originally stored on a system in the research institution and gets transferred to the secure SIESTA storage system.

Uploading is in general considered as "sending data away" over the network, whereas downloading is "receiving data". Specifically for data ingestion into SIESTA, uploading can be considered as the situation where the data rights holder delivers the data at the SIESTA central storage, whereas downloading can be considered where the platform operator picks up the data from the institutional storage or repository. Downloading data is used in the initial use cases (2.1 to 2.5), since the data in those cases is publicly shared, hosted on institutional repositories, and the data rights holder needs to go and pick it up.

For the data transfer into SIESTA we refer to this as _uploading_ in case the platform operator creates an account on the SIESTA platform for the data rights holder and if the latter initiates and controls the transfer. We refer to this as _downloading_ if the data rights holder creates an account for the platform operator on their institutional system, and if the latter initiates and controls the transfer. In neither case is the data user involved in the data transfer.

Note that there is also _downloading_ by the data user of the results of the analysis pipeline, but that is discussed elsewhere in the [corresponding documentation](./data_user.md).

## Data transfer into the system (import)

### Uploading the data by the data rights holder

The data rights holder can use the account and the data transfer mechanism provided by the SIESTA platform operator to upload the data.

### Downloading the data by the platform operator

The data rights holder can provide the platform operator with instructions and access to download the data from the institutional storage system. Besides providing an account to access the data for download and explaining how the data transfer works, the data rights holder must provide a method to check completeness and integrity of the data after transfer, for example by providing a [manifest file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifest_file) with checksums.

## Providing scrambled data

The data rights holder is responsible for providing a scrambled (locally differentially private) version of the dataset to the data user, so that the data user knows what the dataset contains, how it is organized, and that they can implement the analysis pipeline. The scrambling of the data is done using tools such as [BIDScramble](https://bidscramble.readthedocs.io) and [anjana-app](https://github.com/SIESTA-eu/anjana-app).

## Privacy considerations

### For the raw input data

It is the responsibility of the data rights holder to employ data minimization and to ensure that the dataset does not contain information that is not needed for subsequent analyses.

It is the responsibility of the platform operator to ensure that data users cannot access the input data, as that is assumed to contain sensitive information.

In WP15, we have not considered the network and storage aspect on the SIESTA platform, where encryption in transit and at rest may or may not apply.

### For the scrambled data

The scrambled data is needed for the data user to implement and test their analysis pipeline. It is the responsibility of the data rights holder to ensure that data following scrambling does not contain identifiable information. The data rights holder can use tools such as [DatLeak](https://github.com/SIESTA-eu/DatLeak) and [pycanon](https://github.com/IFCA-Advanced-Computing/pycanon) to review the privacy level (in terms of different anonymization techniques) of the scrambled data prior to it being released.

### For the results from the pipeline

The scrambled data is anonymous, hence the pipeline applied to the scrambled data is also anonymous and its result can be shared without restrictions.

The output that results from the pipeline applied to the original input data cannot be guaranteed to be anonymous. Noise needs to be added to this direct output to make the results  differentially private as, for example, explained on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_privacy).

## Differentially private output data

An appropriately calibrated amount of noise is added to the output data to ensure that it is differentially private. The differentially private result can subsequently be shared without restrictions.
